_See the readme file in the main branch for updated instructions and information._
## Instructions
This repository has tags for each of the videos in the course. You can use the branch pop up menu in github to switch to a specific tag and take a look at the course at that stage. You can also use standard git commands to compare any two tags to see what has changed:
```
git diff 02_03e...02_03b
```

## Tags
There are tagged commits that correspond to the videos in the course. The naming convention is `CHAPTER#_MOVIE#`. As an example, the branch named `02_03` corresponds to the second chapter and the third video in that chapter.
Some branches will have a beginning and an end state. These are marked with the letters `b` for "beginning" and `e` for "end". The `b` tag contains the code as it is at the beginning of the movie. The `e` tag contains the code as it is at the end of the movie.
